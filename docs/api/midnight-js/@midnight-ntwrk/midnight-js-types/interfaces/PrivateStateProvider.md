# Interface: PrivateStateProvider\<PSI, PS\>

Interface for a typed key-valued store containing contract private states.

## Type Parameters

### PSI

`PSI` *extends* [`PrivateStateId`](../type-aliases/PrivateStateId.md) = [`PrivateStateId`](../type-aliases/PrivateStateId.md)

Parameter indicating the private state ID, sometimes a union of string literals.

### PS

`PS` = `any`

Parameter indicating the private state type stored, sometimes a union of private state types.

## Methods

### clear()

> **clear**(): `Promise`\<`void`\>

Remove all contract private states.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`void`\>

***

### clearSigningKeys()

> **clearSigningKeys**(): `Promise`\<`void`\>

Remove all contract signing keys.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`void`\>

***

### exportPrivateStates()

> **exportPrivateStates**(`options?`): `Promise`\<[`PrivateStateExport`](PrivateStateExport.md)\>

Export all private states as an encrypted JSON-serializable structure.

NOTE: This does NOT export signing keys for security reasons.

#### Parameters

##### options?

[`ExportPrivateStatesOptions`](ExportPrivateStatesOptions.md)

Export options including optional custom password and state limit.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<[`PrivateStateExport`](PrivateStateExport.md)\>

A JSON-serializable export structure that can be saved or transmitted.

#### Throws

If no states exist to export, the state
  limit is exceeded, or a caller-supplied `options.password` does not
  satisfy the minimum-length policy.

#### Throws

If implementations require a scoped operating context (for
  example, an account or contract address) and that context is not set.

#### Throws

If the password returned by the configured password provider
  does not satisfy the minimum strength policy (validation runs on
  every invocation).

#### Throws

If reading existing entries fails for any of the reasons listed
  on [PrivateStateProvider.get](#get) (decryption failure, rotation
  lock timeout, store I/O).

***

### exportSigningKeys()

> **exportSigningKeys**(`options?`): `Promise`\<[`SigningKeyExport`](SigningKeyExport.md)\>

Export all signing keys as an encrypted JSON-serializable structure.

#### Parameters

##### options?

[`ExportSigningKeysOptions`](ExportSigningKeysOptions.md)

Export options including optional custom password and key limit.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<[`SigningKeyExport`](SigningKeyExport.md)\>

A JSON-serializable export structure that can be saved or transmitted.

#### Throws

If no keys exist to export, the key limit
  is exceeded, or a caller-supplied `options.password` does not satisfy
  the minimum-length policy.

#### Throws

If the password returned by the configured password provider
  does not satisfy the minimum strength policy (validation runs on
  every invocation).

#### Throws

If reading existing entries fails for any of the reasons listed
  on [PrivateStateProvider.getSigningKey](#getsigningkey).

***

### get()

> **get**(`privateStateId`): `Promise`\<`PS` \| `null`\>

Retrieve the private state at the given private state ID.

#### Parameters

##### privateStateId

`PSI`

The private state identifier.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`PS` \| `null`\>

The stored private state, or `null` if either:
  - the key is absent from the underlying store, or
  - the stored value deserializes to `undefined`.

  Callers should treat both `null` outcomes equivalently as "no usable
  value". The provider does not distinguish between an absent key and an
  explicitly-undefined stored value; if the distinction matters for your
  application, store a sentinel value instead.

#### Throws

If `setContractAddress` has not been called prior to invocation.

#### Throws

If the password returned by the configured password provider does
  not satisfy the minimum strength policy. Validation runs on every
  invocation against the password returned by the provider — it is not
  cached.

#### Throws

If decryption of the stored value fails (wrong password, salt
  mismatch, unsupported encryption version, or authentication tag
  mismatch). Decryption errors are propagated to the caller and do **not**
  collapse to `null`.

#### Throws

If a concurrent password rotation does not release its lock
  within the internal default timeout (5 minutes on the read path; the
  read path does not expose a configuration knob).

#### Throws

Underlying store I/O errors are propagated; callers should not
  include them in user-facing messages without redacting paths and
  OS-level metadata.

#### Remarks

Implementations may lazily migrate legacy or unencrypted entries on
read, which means a successful logical read can trigger a write to the
underlying store. In read-only environments (mounted-read-only file
systems, quota-exhausted backends), `get` may reject with an I/O error
even when the value is present and decryptable. The list of decryption
failure modes above is illustrative, not exhaustive — payload
encoding/parse errors, crypto-backend availability errors, and other
corruption modes are also surfaced as throws rather than `null`.

***

### getSigningKey()

> **getSigningKey**(`address`): `Promise`\<`string` \| `null`\>

Retrieve the signing key for a contract.

#### Parameters

##### address

`string`

The address of the contract for which to get the signing key.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`string` \| `null`\>

The stored signing key, or `null` if either:
  - no signing key is stored for the given address, or
  - the stored value deserializes to `undefined`.

  Callers should treat both `null` outcomes equivalently as "no usable
  value".

#### Throws

If the password returned by the configured password provider does
  not satisfy the minimum strength policy. Validation runs on every
  invocation against the password returned by the provider — it is not
  cached.

#### Throws

If decryption of the stored value fails (wrong password, salt
  mismatch, unsupported encryption version, or authentication tag
  mismatch). Decryption errors are propagated to the caller and do **not**
  collapse to `null`.

#### Throws

If a concurrent password rotation does not release its lock
  within the internal default timeout (5 minutes on the read path; the
  read path does not expose a configuration knob).

#### Throws

Underlying store I/O errors are propagated; callers should not
  include them in user-facing messages without redacting paths and
  OS-level metadata.

#### Remarks

Unlike [PrivateStateProvider.get](#get), this method does **not** require
[PrivateStateProvider.setContractAddress](#setcontractaddress) to have been called first —
the contract address is supplied as an argument.

Implementations may lazily migrate legacy or unencrypted entries on
read, which means a successful logical read can trigger a write to the
underlying store. In read-only environments, `getSigningKey` may reject
with an I/O error even when the value is present and decryptable. The
list of decryption failure modes above is illustrative, not exhaustive
— payload encoding/parse errors, crypto-backend availability errors,
and other corruption modes are also surfaced as throws rather than
`null`.

  example, an account or contract address) and that context is not set.

#### Throws

If reading or writing the underlying store fails for any of the
  reasons listed on [PrivateStateProvider.get](#get) or
  [PrivateStateProvider.set](#set).
