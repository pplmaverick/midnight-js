/**
 * Constructs and submits a transaction that replaces the maintenance
 * authority stored on the blockchain for this contract. After the transaction is
 * finalized, the current signing key stored in the given private state provider
 * is overwritten with the given new authority key.
 *
 * ## Transaction Execution Phases
 *
 * Midnight transactions execute in two phases:
 * 1. **Guaranteed phase**: If failure occurs, the transaction is NOT included in the blockchain
 * 2. **Fallible phase**: If failure occurs, the transaction IS recorded on-chain as a partial success
 *
 * ## Failure Behavior
 *
 * **Guaranteed Phase Failure:**
 * - Transaction is rejected and not included in the blockchain
 * - `ReplaceMaintenanceAuthorityTxFailedError` is thrown with transaction data
 * - Signing key in private state provider is NOT updated (remains as current authority)
 * - Contract authority on-chain remains unchanged
 *
 * **Fallible Phase Failure:**
 * - Transaction is recorded on-chain with non-`SucceedEntirely` status
 * - `ReplaceMaintenanceAuthorityTxFailedError` is thrown with transaction data
 * - Signing key in private state provider is NOT updated (remains as current authority)
 * - Contract authority on-chain may be partially updated but inconsistent
 * - Transaction appears in blockchain history as partial success
 *
 * @param providers The providers to use to manage the transaction lifecycle.
 * @param compiledContract The compiled contract for which the maintenance authority
 *                         should be updated.
 * @param contractAddress The address of the contract for which the maintenance
 *                        authority should be updated.
 *
 * TODO: There are at least three options we should support in the future:
 *       1. Replace authority and maintain key (current).
 *       2. Replace authority and do not maintain key.
 *       3. Add additional authorities and maintain original key.
