/**
 * Constructs and submits a transaction that removes the current verifier key stored
 * on the blockchain for the given circuit ID at the given contract address.
 *
 * ## Transaction Execution Phases
 *
 * Midnight transactions execute in two phases:
 * 1. **Guaranteed phase**: If failure occurs, the transaction is NOT included in the blockchain
 * 2. **Fallible phase**: If failure occurs, the transaction IS recorded on-chain as a partial success
 *
 * ## Failure Behavior
 *
 * **Guaranteed Phase Failure:**
 * - Transaction is rejected and not included in the blockchain
 * - `RemoveVerifierKeyTxFailedError` is thrown with transaction data
 * - Verifier key remains on the contract (unchanged)
 * - No on-chain record of the failed transaction
 *
 * **Fallible Phase Failure:**
 * - Transaction is recorded on-chain with non-`SucceedEntirely` status
 * - `RemoveVerifierKeyTxFailedError` is thrown with transaction data
 * - Verifier key may be partially removed but contract state is inconsistent
 * - Transaction appears in blockchain history as partial success
 *
 * @param providers The providers to use to manage the transaction lifecycle.
 * @param compiledContract The compiled contract for which the maintenance authority
 *                         should be updated.
 * @param contractAddress The address of the contract containing the circuit for which
 *                        the verifier key should be removed.
 * @param circuitId The circuit for which the verifier key should be removed.
 *
 * @returns A promise that resolves with the finalized transaction data, or rejects if
 *          an error occurs along the way.
 *
 * @throws {RemoveVerifierKeyTxFailedError} When transaction fails in either guaranteed or fallible phase.
 *         The error contains the finalized transaction data for debugging.
 *
 * TODO: We'll likely want to modify ZKConfigProvider provider so that the verifier keys are
 *       automatically rotated in this function. This likely involves storing key versions
 *       along with keys in ZKConfigProvider. By default, artifacts for the latest version
 *       would be fetched to build transactions.
